# Pyxis
An LXMF client firmware for T-Deck, built on a [highly modified fork](https://github.com/torlando-tech/microReticulum/tree/feat/t-deck) of [microReticulum](https://github.com/attermann/microReticulum)

Very much WIP, don't expect stability :) 

## Features
Reticulum transport over: 
- RNode-compatible LoRa
- AutoInterface (local wifi)
- TCP Client
- BLE Interface (barely working if at all)

Other features:
- GPS-synced time
- One really annoying beep when you get a new message (user toggle)
- View the announce stream
- Choose a propagation node (and sync with it)
- Set auto announce timer
- Light up keyboard (user toggle)
- Will crash in about 5 minutes of normal use (sorry)

## Why "Pyxis"
Pyxis, latin for "compass," is a [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis) in the southern sky depicting a mariner's compass. Small but essential, the compass ensures every message finds its destination - even when the path is uncertain.
